Torres has been capped over 100 times and is Spain’s third-highest goalscorer of all-time. He has been described as having “an eye for the spectacular” and is regarded as a technically proficient, highly successful striker. Several injuries have led to a loss of form, pace, confidence and a decreased goal scoring rate in recent times.




Background



At the age of five, Torres became interested in football and joined his first team, Parque 84. He began playing football as a goalkeeper and after two years started playing regularly as a striker.

Atlético won the tournament and Torres was voted as the best player in Europe for that age group. He made his debut for the senior Atlético Madrid team on 27 May 2001 against Leganes at the Vicente Calderón Stadium.

He became the first person in history to score four goals in one game in a FIFA Confederations Cup match against Tahiti in a 10-0 victory in the 2013 Confederations Cup.


Rise to glory



Torres scored seven goals in 11 appearances in qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, making him Spain’s top scorer for qualification, including his first international hat-trick which came against San Marino.



Torres scored the match winning goal against Germany in the final of Euro 2008 and was named the man of the match. For his impressive performance in the tournament , he featured as a striker in the Team of the Tournament.
In the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, he scored his second hat-trick for Spain. He scored the hat-trick after just 17 minutes from the start of play, thus recording the fastest hat-trick by a Spanish footballer.

Club Career

Torres made his debut for Liverpool on 11 August 2007 against Aston Villa in a 2-1 victory. He became the first Liverpool player since Jack Balmer in November 1946 to score a hat-trick in two successive home matches. He was a star player for Liverpool as he scored 65 goals in 102 appearances for the club.



Torres moved to Chelsea on a five-and-a-half-year contract on 31 January 2011 for a transfer fee reported to be £50 million, which set a new record for a British transfer and made him the sixth most expensive footballer in history.
